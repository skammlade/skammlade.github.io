#### [The Changing Global Diet](http://ciat.cgiar.org/the-changing-global-diet/)
**Project Summary:**  CIAT was interested in making existing research accessible to a wider audience and digging deeper into a large dataset. To that end I built multiple interactive dashboards in Tableau and helped design a compelling website to showcase key findings. In the process I cleaned raw source data, built a database of global crop consumption, performed data transformations, and conducted statistical analyses.  Read more about the project in this (blog)[http://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/five-surprising-ways-peoples-diets-have-changed-over-the-past-50-years/](http://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/five-surprising-ways-peoples-diets-have-changed-over-the-past-50-years/]  
**Organization:** International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)   
**Recognition:**  Tableau 'Viz of the Day' April 24, 2017  
**Workflow:**

* create database for data transformations and analysis in SQL Server - started with raw data, built a suitable schema, loaded the raw data, cleaned and normalized the data, and wrote queries to analyze and ultimately visualize the data [(SQL scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/skammlade.github.io/tree/master/projects/tableau/SQLServerQueries)
* conduct statistical analysis in R [(R scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/skammlade.github.io/blob/master/projects/tableau/RScripts/NMDS_decade.R) 
* create statistical report in R using R Markdown for a species diversity analysis [(example report)](https://github.com/skammlade/skammlade.github.io/blob/master/projects/tableau/RScripts/NMDSAnalysis.markdown)
* create interactive data visualizations in Tableau 
* build temporary website for collaboration using HTML

#### Dietary fiber content in common bean from the middle american gene pool   
**Project Summary:** Determine differences in fiber content (soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, and oligosaccharides) between races and market classes of dry beans. By quantifying one of the largest gene pools, breeders of *phaseoulous vulgaris* can use this information as a guide for choosing germplasm to incorporate into breeding programs with specific fiber improvement goals.    
**Organization:** Colorado State University     
**Dates:** May 2016 - December 2016    
**Workflow:**   

* statistical analysis in SAS [(SAS scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/bean_fiber/SAS)
* data visualizations in R using ggplot2 [(R scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/bean_fiber) 
* reporting in R using R Markdown [(example report 1](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/blob/master/bean_fiber/bean_fiber.Rmd) , [example report 2)](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/blob/master/bean_fiber/bean_fiber.pdf)

#### Weather Data Analysis
**Project Summary:** A closer look at weather changes in major metro areas across the United States. I looked at the greatest 100 hourly precipitation events from 1950-2016 in 9 major cities.  
**Organization:** Personal project  
**Dates:** 2017   
**Workflow:**    

* retrieve data from NOAA 
* clean and transform data in SQL Server [(SQL scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/WeatherDataAnalysis)  
* visualize in [RShiny app](https://skammlade.shinyapps.io/precipitationrankapp/) [(R scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/WeatherDataAnalysis/tree/master/PrecipitationRankApp) 
* report in markdown [(README.md)](https://github.com/skammlade/WeatherDataAnalysis/blob/master/README.md)

#### Master's Thesis
**Project Summary:** Evaluate the effects of management on soil health properties such as organic carbon, organic nitrogen, and soil microbial respiration; evalute the effects of location on soil food web composition where locations vary by amounts of soil organic carbon, organic nitrogen, and soil organic matter; determine the effects of potato genotype on soil food web composition.   
**Organization:** Colorado Potato Breeding and Selection Program    
**Dates:** January 2013 - December 2015    
**Workflow:**    

* experimental design  
* statistical analysis in SAS [(SAS scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/FoodWeb/SAS)
* tables and figures in R and microsoft Excel [(R scripts)](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/FoodWeb/R)
