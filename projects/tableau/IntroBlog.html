		<p> Over the past 50 years, diets around the world have changed 
		</p>
		
		<p> <b><em>Diets are more diverse</em></b>
		</p>
		
		<p>People’s diets across the globe are comprised of more and more different crop products. This is especially important when countries staple crops are diversifying so instead of relying on one crop, two or more crops contribute to the majority of their caloric needs. In the 1960s, Chinese diets were comprised of predominantly rice. More recently, their diets are comprised of wheat, potatoes, and rice.</p>
