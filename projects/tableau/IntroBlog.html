		</p>
		
		<p>It&#39;s always interesting, albeit disconcerting, to learn that one&#39;s preconceptions are largely misconceptions. This sums up the experience of our team of biodiversity researchers, who dived into <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home"target="_blank">global data</a> on what plants people have eaten around the world over the past 50 years. We were looking for evidence of the gradual disappearance of the variety of crops in people&#39;s diets, an assumption aligned with the oft-repeated mantra that we have <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5609e/y5609e02.htm"target="_blank">already lost 75%</a> of our agricultural diversity. We didn&#39;t find it, for reasons explained more fully <insert CIAT GPC blog link>.</p>
		
		<p>What we did find was change, change, change. Massive change in the foods people eat. Crop winners and losers. And most of all, evidence of much greater similarity in diets worldwide, as economic and agricultural development has proceeded and as food systems have globalized.
        </p>
		
		<p>When we published our findings of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313490111"target="_blank">increasing homogeneity in global food supplies</a>, we hadn&#39;t yet found a good way to make the underlying data readily visible to interested readers. This is why we are tremendously excited to announce the publication of our new <a href="http://ciat.cgiar.org/the-changing-global-diet/"target="_blank">Changing Global Diet</a> website, which provides interactive explorations for 152 countries over five decades of change. We hope that you enjoy your investigations through time, and are as surprised as we were with the evident trends.
        </p>
		
		<p>For a taste of the research, here&#39;s five ways that we were surprised to have found that people&#39;s diets have changed over the past 50 years:
		</p>
	
	<p> <b>1. Almost everybody eats a lot more food than their grandparents did. And it's more diverse.</b>

	<p> Okay, so the fact that most everybody eats more food than did their ancestors wasn’t such a shocker. What did surprise us is that most countries’ food supplies have gotten a lot more diverse with regard to the crops reported in FAO data. That means that countries reported consuming a longer list of plants, and also that the relative contribution of each of these foods became more even within national food supplies. We found that food supplies that were primarily based upon singular staples a half a century ago, for instance rice in Southeast Asia, had diversified over time to include other staples such as wheat and potatoes. The same was true for maize-based diets in Latin America, sorghum- and millet-based diets in sub-Saharan Africa, and so on. Check out United Arab Emirates in the figure below, for example, which reported a 370% increase over 50 years in the number of crops contributing to calories in the national food supply, diversifying well beyond its an initial reported monotony of rice, wheat and sugar.  </p>

	<p> <b>2. African and Asian countries have the world’s most diverse food supplies. Also the least.</b>
		</p>
	
	<p> Comparing the levels of diversity of countries’ current food supplies around the world, we were surprised to find that both the most and the least diverse of these were largely nations in Africa and Asia. Based on per capita national food supply data, and measured using Shannons Diversity Index, a common diversity measurement that accounts not only for the number of crops, but also the relative abundance of each of the crops contributing to the food supply (the more evenly all crops contribute, the more diverse the diet is considered to be), Cameroon had the world’s most diverse food supply with regard to available calories. Bangladesh, meanwhile, had the least, reporting only 27 crops, and with 70% of calories from rice alone. </p>
	
	
	<center> <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1492642103048' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 5 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Th&#47;TheChangingGlobalDietBlog-TheMostDiverseFoodSupplies&#47;Dashboard5&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='TheChangingGlobalDietBlog-TheMostDiverseFoodSupplies&#47;Dashboard5' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Th&#47;TheChangingGlobalDietBlog-TheMostDiverseFoodSupplies&#47;Dashboard5&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1492642103048');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='904px';vizElement.style.height='1039px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script> </center>
	
	
	<p> One big caveat, though- we were only able to assess crops reported in FAO national food supply data, which unfortunately is currently limited to reporting 52 meaningful crop species-specific commodities. While these 52 include the most important crops globally, they certainly don’t cover the sum total of all plants that people eat. Crops not explicitly listed in the data are either thrown into the reported general categories such as “cereals, other” or aren’t measured at all, especially if they are only produced on a small scale, for local markets or in home gardens. We need better statistics about what people eat (and grow) around the world, especially since studies have shown that many locally relevant crops are in decline. </p>
	
	<p> <b>3. Crop immigrants are the key to dietary diversity </b>
		</p>
	
	<p> If there were crop winners over the past 50 years, among these would be the mega-crops (wheat, rice, maize and sugar), which clearly maintained their global importance. The biggest winners, though, were oils such as soybean, palm oil, sunflower and rapeseed, which over five decades progressed from regional significance to global dominance. As the winners came to take more precedence in food supplies around the world, traditional cereals such as sorghum, millets, and rye, and starchy roots such as cassava, sweet potato, and yam, were marginalized.  </p>

	<p> The diversification of countries’ food supplies over the past 50 years seems to largely have come about by introducing exotic staples as they became globally available. Traditional rice-based food supplies in Southeast Asia diversified to include non-traditional staples such as wheat and potatoes. The same was true for maize-based diets in Latin America, and sorghum- and millet-based diets in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
	
	<p> In related research on the origins of food crops, we found that about 69% of plants consumed on average around the world are “foreign” in the sense that they are originally from in distant regions of the world. The trend of countries consuming crop “immigrants” significantly increased over the past five decades, and especially in countries that developed new agricultural production industries based on these exotic plants. Brazil’s investment in growing soybean, a crop with origins in East Asia, increased the consumption of the crop in the Brazilian diet (and seems to have been a primary driver in increasing overall fat from plants in the diet), while marginalizing traditional foods such as groundnut (peanut).  </p>

	<p> <b>4. The world is eating more like Cape Verde, Colombia, and Peru </b>
		</p>
	
	<p> As countries’ food supplies became more diverse in the winner crops reported by FAO, and the relative abundance of crops within diets became more even, food supplies worldwide became much more similar. If we are what we eat, then it seems we are quickly becoming very much the same type of human being- modern people eating globalized food crops. </p>
	
	<p>Clicking through to modern times in the figure, the compositions of countries’ food supplies are clearly converging just above and to the left of the global average (center). This convergence is mostly toward European- and North American-type food supplies, with a few surprising additional countries in the mix.  </p>
	
	<p> African, Asian, and Pacific Island countries remain the furthest distance from this convergence, and pull the current global average diet some distance away from cluster. The nations that are currently closest to the global average diet include Cape Verde, Colombia, and Peru! And while the figure clearly shows that there is no such thing, in reality, as a global average diet, it’s visualization through time does bolster the argument that the concept of a global average is has more validity now that it did 50 years ago. More countries are closer to that centerpoint than ever before. See the bar chart to explore what crops the current global average diet is composed of. </p>

	<p> <b>5. Political unrest can lead to greater diversity in people’s diets, or not </b>
		</p>
	
	<p> Exploring the food supplies of countries such as Albania, Argentina, Cuba, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, it’s pretty clear that periods of political unrest are correlated with the disruption of people’s access to an abundant and diverse food supply. Nothing about that is surprising. But what happens after the shock is.</p>
	
	<p> In some cases, such as in Cuba’s Periodo Especial, the total quantities of food declined, and in fact still haven’t fully recovered. Yet, the diversity of contributing crops within the food supply increased, for example with regard to fat in the food supply, as the country consumed more soybean and palm oil in order to adjust to the declining availability of the sunflower that had previously been imported from the Soviet Union. In other cases, such as the fall of communism in Albania, disruption seems to have led to greater total quantities of food, but also simplification of the food supply.   </p>
