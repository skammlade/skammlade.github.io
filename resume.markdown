#### Dietary fiber content in common bean from the middle american gene pool   
**Project Summary:** Determine differences in fiber content (soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, and oligosaccharides) between races and market classes of dry beans. By quantifying one of the largest gene pools, breeders of *phaseoulous vulgaris* can use this information as a guide for choosing germplasm to incorporate into breeding programs with specific fiber improvement goals.

**Code files:** [https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/bean_fiber](https://github.com/skammlade/manuscripts/tree/master/bean_fiber)   
**Workflow:**   

* statistical analysis in RStudio (one-way ANOVA, )
* data visualizations in RStudio using ggplot2
